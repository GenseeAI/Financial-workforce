This figure is slightly below the emissions recorded in 2022. In contrast, the user query specifically mentions Scope 3 emissions from energy product sales in 2023 as 878 million, which does not align with the report's data. \\n\\nThe report also highlights Shell's commitment to reducing emissions from the use of its oil products by 15–20% by 2030, using 2021 as the baseline. This goal is part of Shell's broader strategy to address its significant carbon footprint, where Scope 3 emissions account for nearly 90% of its total emissions. \\n\\nAdditionally, Shell reported a reduction in its combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions to 57 million tonnes of CO₂ equivalent, down 2% from 2022 and 31% lower than its 2016 baseline. The company aims to cut these emissions by 50% by 2030. \\n\\nOverall, while Shell is making strides in reducing its emissions, the challenge remains significant, particularly with Scope 3 emissions, which are not decreasing at the same rate as its operational emissions.\", 'engine': 'tavily_search', 'engines': ['tavily_search']}, {'title': 'Shell Publishes Energy Transition Strategy 2024', 'url': 'https://energynow.com/2024/03/shell-publishes-energy-transition-strategy-2024/', 'content': \"- In the Shell Sustainability Report 2023, it is stated that customer emissions from the use of Shell's oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023.
