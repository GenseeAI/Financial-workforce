The company reported revenues exceeding $30 billion, marking a 122% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year, and a net income rise of 168% to nearly $16.6 billion. Despite these impressive figures, Nvidia's stock price fell sharply, leading to a record loss in market capitalization of nearly $280 billion. This decline has been attributed to several factors, including high investor expectations, concerns over a potential slowdown in AI-related chip purchases, and delays in the rollout of its new Blackwell chip.\\n\\nAnalysts have mixed views on Nvidia's future. While some maintain high price targets, others express caution, suggesting that the company may face a short-term correction. The anticipation surrounding the Blackwell chip's contribution to future revenues remains uncertain, as company leaders did not provide specific figures during the earnings call. Additionally, there are broader concerns about the sustainability of global demand for AI technologies, with some experts suggesting that the chip market may be nearing its peak.\\n\\nOverall, while Nvidia's business performance has been strong, investor sentiment has cooled due to a combination of unrealistic expectations and potential market challenges. Analysts remain divided, with some optimistic about Nvidia's long-term prospects, given its dominant position in the high-speed chip market for AI systems.\", 'engine': 'exa_search', 'engines': ['exa_search']}], tool_call_id='call_uWwGBASA2EXbKGnyt6XenhYk', images=None), ToolCallingRecord(tool_name='scale_search_sync', args={'query': 'site:sec.gov/Archives amd-20241228 Research and development expense', 'max_results': 5}, result=[{'title': 'amd-20241228 - SEC.gov', 'url': 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2488/000000248825000012/amd-20241228.htm', 'content': \"- The document provides detailed information about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.
